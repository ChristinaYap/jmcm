* jmcm: Joint Mean-Covariance Models in ~R~

** Features
- Efficient for large data sets, using algorithms from the Armadillo linear
  algebra package via the RcppArmadillo interface layer.
- Fits joint mean-covariance models based on three Cholesky decomposition-based
  covariance structure modelling methods, namely modified Cholesky
  decomposition (MCD), alternative Cholesky decomposition (ACD) and
  hyperpherical parameterization of Cholesky factor (HPC).  

** Installation
